# Session Start

Before writing any code, build context by answering these questions:

## 1. WHERE am I? (Plan)
Read `dev/PLAN.md`
- Which phase is active?
- What's the goal of this phase?

## 2. HOW does it fit? (Architecture)
Read `dev/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Which component am I working on?
- How does it connect to other parts?
- Is the architecture still accurate?

## 3. WHAT happened? (Handover)
Read `dev/HANDOVER.md`
- What was done last session?
- Any unfinished work?
- Any warnings or hints?

## 4. WHAT's messy? (Refactoring)
Look at relevant code:
- What's currently unclear or duplicated?
- Can this feature simplify existing code?
- Any TODOs or FIXMEs to address?

## 5. WHAT now? (Task)
Now define your task:
- What exactly will I build?
- What files will I touch?
- What's the smallest working increment?

**Then:** `gh issue list` for open issues, `git status` for uncommitted work.
